## Installation

This starter is an up to date template for create-next-app with some built in linting and nice things that I like to start my projects off with. Particularly the linting and dev tools I usually set my packages up with from Lass.

```sh
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/spence-s/spence-s-next-starter
```

or

```sh
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/spence-s/spence-s-next-starter
```


## From create-next-app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
